Middleware - code which runs (on the server) between getting a request and sending a response


SERVER:
- app.use(func) - usually used to run middleware code
- app.get

- app.use(func) - usually used to run middleware code


Middleware Examples
we can create middleware that:
- log details of every request (logger middleware)
- checks authentication for protected routes (authentication check middleware)
- parse JSON data from requests 
- return 404 pages


MORGAN - a logger middleware


static - middleware embedded along with expressJS that allows static files to be accessed
- naturally, static files are protected by the server not to be accessed in the browser
- to use, app.use(express.static('public'))
- static files are assets u use in ur site
